  <ul>
    <li><em>Use wildcards to match filenames.</em></li>
    <li><em>'*' is a wildcard pattern that matches zero or more characters in a pathname.</em></li>
    <li><em>'?' is a wildcard pattern that matches any single character.</em></li>
    <li><em>The shell matches wildcards before running commands.</em></li>
    <li>Wildcards are useful when performing actions on more than one
    file at a time.</li>
    <li>We can use wildcard patterns for nearly any command (cp, mv, rm,
    etc.)</li>
    <li>Globbing is the process through which wildcard patterns are
    matched to filenames.</li>
    <li>You can use multiple wildcard expressions in a single glob</li>
